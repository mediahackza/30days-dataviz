### Code editor

WE recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing the code.

### Using the terminal

You will need to run some of the node setup commands in a terminal. Depending on your platform there are various terminal options. On Mac you can use the [built-in terminal app](https://www.howtogeek.com/682770/how-to-open-the-terminal-on-a-mac/). On Windows you can use the [built-in Command Prompt app (CMD)](https://www.webucator.com/article/how-to-run-a-nodejs-application-on-windows/). On Linux you can search for the "terminal" app and run that.

Your terminal will look something like this (it may vary in colour):
