    		This is an experiment, and a challenge. For the next 30 days (December 2021) I plan to write a
    		series on creating basic, but presentable, charts using Svelte and D3.js. Starting with the
    		basics, each day will expand on the day before so that, hopefully, we'll have a complete
    		working example of component-based charts by the end of the year.

    	## Why?

    		I'm relatively new to Svelte but a long-time user of D3. I love what I can do with D3 but I'm
    		often frustrated by how long and how much work it takes to create a chart. Then I discovered
    		Svelte and realised that Svelte and D3 can work together pretty well. D3 has a lot of the
    		power you need to make charts (think scales, axes etc) while Svelte makes it almost trivial to
    		update cahrt elements and handle data changes. Svelte also makes it a lot easier to split
    		charts into their component parts which simplifies reuse.

    	I'm by no means an expert in this and this project is partially my way of working out the best way
    	to do things. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.



    	## What is Svelte?
    	Svelte is a relatively new Javascript framework/library that helps build Javascript-based websites
    	and apps. Working in Svelte will feel familiar to anyone that has used a framework like Vue.js or
    	React. The difference with Svelte is that before we make our code public we compile it into its final
    	form and then only publish the compiled code and none of the Svelte framework code. Sounds tricky
    	but it's not.

    	**Resources**: Svelte has an excellent, [interactive tutorial site](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics).

    	## What is D3?

    	D3.js is a Javascript library that can be used to build interactive web elements and
    	charts. In this series we'll make charts that are built on SVG, or scalable vector graphics which
    	D3 is extremely flexible but it can be complicated to learn. D3 does not have pre-built charts like
    	other tools such as [Flourish](https://flourish.studio) and [Datawrapper](https://datawrapper.de)
    	which means it needs more work to start but the options are andless.

    	**Resources**: The [D3 gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery)
    	has examples of graphics created using D3.js

    	## Why Svelte and D3.js?

    	There are many reasons for
    	combining D3 and Svelte but the biggest is that they complement each other really well. In this series
    	we'll look at how to take the best of D3 and the best of Svelte to make something amazing. (More
    	reasons may follow but for noe that will do).
